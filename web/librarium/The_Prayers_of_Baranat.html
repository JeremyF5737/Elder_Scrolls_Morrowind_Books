            <p>When the Lady <span class="person" id="Genevrah">Genevrah</span> was kidnapped from her estate and held for ransom, her mother sent word out that
               whoever rescued her would be allowed to marry her and inherit the land. Unfortunately,
               in those troubled days, kidnappings, murders, and thievery were rampant, and there
               was a dearth of able-bodied adventurers for such assignments. In fact, the only person
               who answered her call was a skinny, little fellow named <span class="person">Baranat</span>.</p>
            
            <p>"You are certainly brave, but I fear you would never survive," said the old woman.
               "My daughter, you see, has been kidnapped by the Coribael brothers whose physical
               prowess is the stuff of legend."</p>
            
            <p>"My lady," said <span class="person">Baranat</span>. "When I was born, I was blessed by <span class="person">Vivec</span>, <span class="person">Almalexia</span>, and <span class="person">Sotha Sil</span>, and I have the ear of the saints. If I run into any trouble, I'll call on them to
               aid my quest."</p>
            
            <p>Doubtful, but having no other prospects, the old woman sent <span class="person">Baranat</span> off, explaining that the four brothers' camp was to the north. In the center of the
               camp, the eldest and most powerful brother <span class="person">Airen Coribael</span> was holding Lady <span class="person">Genevrah</span> personally. Each of his brothers guarded a different post along the valley -- <span class="person">Baranat</span> would have to defeat each to rescue the lady.</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Baranat</span> rode many miles through the northern swamps before he came to the first of the brothers'
               guard posts. There he saw <span class="person">Vanis Coribael</span>, the youngest of the brothers, watching the valley for intruders. Vanis was known
               to be faster than the wind, a warrior who could thrash his opponents before they even
               unsheathed their weapons. <span class="person">Baranat</span> look a look at his sad, cut-rate iron blade, and prayed to the saints.</p>
            
            <p>Saint <span class="person">Veloth</span> the Pilgrim appeared before <span class="person">Baranat</span> in shining robes, and smiled upon him, "<span class="person">Baranat</span>, put down your blade and I will make you swifter than bolt of lightning."</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Baranat</span> dropped his blade and ran at Vanis, moving so fast he didn't rustle a leaf with his
               pace. In a flash, Vanis was dead by <span class="person">Baranat</span>'s hands. The adventurer continued on until he reached the second youngest Coribael
               brother, Feryn, who not only was as fast as Vanis, but so strong, he could rip a <span class="item" id="trama shrub"></span>trama shrub up by the roots with two fingers. <span class="person">Baranat</span> hid himself and trembled as he looked at the <span class="group" id="giant">giant</span> Feryn Coribael. Again, the young adventurer prayed to the saints.</p>
            
            <p>Saint Nerevar the Captain appeared before <span class="person">Baranat</span> in golden armor, and smiled upon him, "<span class="person">Baranat</span>, I will make you stronger than a hundred warriors."</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Baranat</span> rushed at Feryn, knocking the <span class="group">giant</span> through a boulder which turned to dust on impact. Feryn tried to get to his feet,
               but <span class="person">Baranat</span> tore him apart, scattering him across the valley floor in eighty-seven pieces. Beyond
               Feryn's post was a raging river, where the second eldest Coribael brother, Horis,
               stood guard. Horis, who was faster than his brother Vanis, stronger than his brother
               Feryn, and so tough that he could swim in the lava of <span class="location">Dagoth Ur</span> like it was the <span class="location">Padomaic Ocean</span>. <span class="person">Baranat</span> thought of his own tolerance for pain, which was minimal, and prayed to the saints
               for help.</p>
            
            <p>Saint <span class="person">Roris</span> the Martyr appeared before <span class="person">Baranat</span> with flesh like sparkling gems, and smiled on him, "<span class="person">Baranat</span>, I will make you unyielding as the heart of <span class="location">Oblivion</span>."</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Baranat</span> rushed at Horis, and two plunged into the rushing river. For twelve hours, they wrestled
               one another under the water, until Horis could hold his breath no more and drowned.
               <span class="person">Baranat</span> pulled himself out of the river and continued down the valley, until he reached the
               camp. <span class="person">Airen Coribael</span> himself was there, guarding a squirming sack which <span class="person">Baranat</span> assumed either contained Lady <span class="person">Genevrah</span> or several large cats. The young adventurer quailed at the prospect of doing battle
               with <span class="person">Airen Coribael</span>, the swiftest, strongest, sturdiest, and most accomplished fighter of the brothers.
               He prayed to the saints for help.</p>
            
            <p>Saint <span class="person">Olms</span> the Just appeared before <span class="person">Baranat</span> in a burst of flame, and smiled on him, "<span class="person">Baranat</span>, I will make you more cunning in battle than the most dangerous of <span class="group">daedra</span>."</p>
            
            <p><span class="person">Baranat</span> walked calmly into the camp and began battle with <span class="person">Airen Coribael</span>. The fight lasted seven days, and for six of them, Airen had the upper hand. He rained
               kicks and punches down using the arrhythmic style the <span class="group">Khajiit</span> call <span class="person">Goutfang</span>; he parried and blocked in all the fashions of the great <span class="group">Nordic</span> warriors; he maintained his balance, coordination, speed, strength, timing, and tactics
               as the moons rose and fell from the sky. But on the seventh day, as he was preparing
               his Killing Blow, he suddenly stopped, eyes wide open. The blood drained from his
               face, and he realized the trap he had stepped into. A trap with no escape. With three
               quick flashes of his hand, <span class="person">Baranat</span> completed the Cycle of Blood, the old <span class="group">Redguard</span> fighting style he had begun on day one. <span class="person">Airen Coribael</span> breathed no more.</p>
            
            <p>The young adventurer ran to open the sack where Lady <span class="person">Genevrah</span> lay. His first surprise. She had a face like a <span class="group">dreugh</span> and as she began to berate him for taking his time, he realized that she had a very,
               very, very unpleasant personality as well. Several days later, when they were back
               at the old woman's court, he discovered that the estate that he would be inheriting
               was utterly dissolute by decades of blight storms and poor crops.</p>
            
            <p>Saint <span class="person">Delyn</span> the Wise watched the young adventurer from a cloud in the sky, and smiled on him,
               "<span class="person">Baranat</span>, before you fight, find out what you're fighting for."</p>
