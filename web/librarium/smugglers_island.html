      <h1>Smuggler's Island</h1>
      <h2>Quarde Anarion</h2>
      <h3>Acquisitions</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Ashinabi: Visitable? yes</li>
         <li>Falasmaryon: Visitable? yes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>It took a little over an hour for <span class="person" id="Harithoel">Harithoel</span> to search the island from one end to the other. He turned back to <span class="person">S'Riizh</span> who was were he left him, half buried in the sand to pack his broken bones. One of
         the crates of <span class="item" id="moonsugar">moon sugar</span> was open.</p>
      
      
      <p>"You're sampling the merchandise?" asked <span class="person">Harithoel</span> angrily.</p>
      
      
      <p>"It takes away the pain," said <span class="person">S'Riizh</span>. "How far away are we?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"We didn't make it as far as the mainland," said <span class="person">Harithoel</span>. "I can't see the coastline at all. But that's not all. I haven't found anything
         edible anywhere. Just weeds and a few scraggly trees."</p>
      
      
      <p>"And no other survivors?" asked <span class="person">S'Riizh</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>"No, it looks like we're the only ones. I guess, the nice way to look at it is that
         if we're rescued, we can divide the profits between two rather than between twelve."</p>
      
      
      <p>"So we'll either be rich or dead," said <span class="person">S'Riizh</span>. "That's a comfort."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">S'Riizh</span> was too battered to be of much help, but <span class="person">Harithoel</span> was able to construct a crude shelter, weaving the sand weeds. As night fell on the
         small island, the two men discussed the smuggling operation and what went wrong. Their
         boat, laden with five crates of <span class="item">moon sugar</span>, was supposed to meet another, the Sanchariot, off the coast of <span class="location">Hla Oad</span>. Who could have predicted the storm? Who could have predicted that everyone would
         drown, from the bold captain to the mysterious figure with ties to one of the royal
         Houses, everyone except for <span class="person">S'Riizh</span> and <span class="person">Harithoel</span>. They decided that it was all the whim of <span class="person">Boethiah</span> or one of the other <span class="group" id="daedra">daedra</span> with cruel senses of humor.</p>
      
      
      <p>Finding fresh water was their first goal, and it turned out to be a fruitless quest.
         <span class="person">Harithoel</span> dug deeply, but there were no springs under the island, just sand and rock. <span class="person">S'Riizh</span> felt panic seizing his soul, until he saw the small, quick, golden fish swimming
         at the edges of the island. He had read somewhere that fish not only were food, but
         there was always a little fresh water within them. If he could catch one, the two
         men could be saved. With his broken legs, he was a pathetic predator and he was soon
         reduced to hurling rocks at the alert and nimble little fish.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Harithoel</span> watched <span class="person">S'Riizh</span>'s futile endeavor for a little while before getting to work. He used his small knife
         to whittle a point on a long, straight tree branch until he had fashioned a spear.
         Again and again, he thrust the spear at the fish, but he had no more success than
         <span class="person">S'Riizh</span> and his stones.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Have you never used a spear before?" asked <span class="person">S'Riizh</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>"It's not my weapon of choice," said <span class="person">Harithoel</span>, quietly, watching his prey and missing another with a splash and a curse. "Nchow!"</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">S'Riizh</span> laughed: "Do you want a rock?"</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Harithoel</span> ignored <span class="person">S'Riizh</span>, murmuring, "The trick as I've heard it is to anticipate where your target's going
         to go and aim your spear there, not where they are now. I just have to observe them
         a little longer. Why can't the little fechers swim in straight lines?"</p>
      
      
      <p>After an hour of flailing about, <span class="person">Harithoel</span>, by luck, managed to spear a fish. The men tore it apart and ate it raw. As the days
         and weeks went by, <span class="person">Harithoel</span> got better and better until he was able to strike quickly and with great accuracy.
         He could hit a fish by throwing the spear or by plunging at one at his feet. <span class="person">S'Riizh</span> made fire, but being lame, he had to rely on <span class="person">Harithoel</span> for all the food.</p>
      
      
      <p>It was nearly two months after washing ashore that the men saw a boat on the horizon.
         They set a large fire, and the crew saw them. As it approached, they saw that it was
         the Sanchariot, the very boat they were to have met on the night of the storm. The
         smugglers aboard would pay them good money for the <span class="item">moon sugar</span>. Luckily, <span class="person">S'Riizh</span> had used only a little bit of it, and they still had five nearly full crates. They
         were not only going to be saved, they were going to be rich, just as <span class="person">Harithoel</span> had said.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Harithoel</span> excitedly started to help <span class="person">S'Riizh</span> to his feet, but the man rose on his own.</p>
      
      
      <p>"You can walk!" he said, laughing. "It's a miracle!"</p>
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">S'Riizh</span> is not too steady, though," said <span class="person">S'Riizh</span>. "Would you gather up the crates?"</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Harithoel</span>, overjoyed at rescue at long last, began picking up the crates and stacking them.
         "I wish you had told me that you could walk though, mate. I could have used your help
         spearing dinner all these months."</p>
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">S'Riizh</span> watches though," said <span class="person">S'Riizh</span>. "You'd be surprised how much you can learn just by watching. Don't forget the fifth
         crate over by the tree." <span class="person">S'Riizh</span> shuffled over to the shore and saw that the boat was only a few minutes from landing.
         "And <span class="person">S'Riizh</span> listens. When you said that a fortune divided by two was more profitable than a fortune
         divided by twelve, <span class="person">S'Riizh</span> listened to that too." <span class="person">S'Riizh</span> shuffled back to the crate by the tree. "And it occurred to <span class="person">S'Riizh</span> that a fortune divided by one was even better." <span class="person">S'Riizh</span> pulled the spear out of <span class="person">Harithoel</span>'s skull. The trajectory had been perfect: it had fallen down from the branches as
         soon as the crate was removed, just as he had planned. "Like you said, the trick is
         to anticipate where your target's going to go and aim your spear there."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">S'Riizh</span> pushed the crate to the shore and waved the boat in.</p>
