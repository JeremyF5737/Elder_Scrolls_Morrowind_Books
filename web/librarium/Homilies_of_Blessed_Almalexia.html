      <p><span class="person" id="SothaSil">Sotha Sil</span> and the <span class="person">Scribs</span></p>
      
      
      
      <p> Young <span class="person">Sotha Sil</span>, while playing in the egg mines, saw a number of scribs in a deep shaft, and he began
         to cast stones upon them, snickering as they skittered and scattered, until one of
         the scribs, lifting its head up in agony, cried out to <span class="person">Sotha Sil</span>: "Please, please, have mercy, little boy, for what is sport to you is suffering and
         death to us."
         
         And so <span class="person">Sotha Sil</span> discovered that the idle of amusements of one may be the solemn tortures of another.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>Lord <span class="person">Vivec</span> and the Contentious Beasts</p>
      
      
      
      <p> A <span class="person">Shalk</span> and a <span class="person">kagouti</span> were strutting back and forth in a <span class="location">foyada</span>, casting aspersions of one another's looks. "You are the ugliest creature alive,"
         the <span class="person">Shalk</span> told the <span class="person">kagouti</span>. "No, YOU are the ugliest creature alive," the <span class="person">kagouti</span> told the <span class="person">Shalk</span>. For each thought himself most handsome, and the other most ugly.
         
         Then Lord <span class="person">Vivec</span> chanced by, and settled their dispute. "No, you BOTH are the ugliest creatures alive,
         and I will not have my pleasant sojourn spoiled by your unseemly squabbling." So he
         dealt them both mighty blows, shattering their skulls, and silencing their argument,
         and went merrily upon his way.
         
         And thus Lord <span class="person">Vivec</span> proved that ugliness is as much in one's manner as in one's appearance.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> The Boiled <span class="person">kagouti</span></p>
      
      
      
      <p> It is said that if a <span class="person">kagouti</span> steps into a boiling pool, he will leap out immediately to avoid harm.
         
         But if the <span class="person">kagouti</span> is standing in a pool, and a wizard slowly raises the temperature, measure by measure,
         to boiling, the <span class="person">kagouti</span> will calmly stand in place until he is boiled.
         
         Thus we see that we must be alert not only to the obvious danger, but also to the
         subtle degrees by which change may result in danger.
         </p>
      
      
      <p> The Dubious Healer</p>
      
      
      
      <p> Once upon a time, a <span class="group" id="HouseTelvanni">Telvanni</span> issued forth from his tower and proclaimed to all the world that he was a mighty
         and learned healer, master of all alchemy and potions, and able to cure all diseases.
         
         Lord <span class="person">Vivec</span> looked upon this wizard, and listened to his boasting, then asked him, "How can you
         pretend to prescribe for others the cure to all diseases, when you are unable to cure
         yourself of your own manifest arrogance and foolishness?"
         </p>
      
      
      <p>The <span class="person">Guar</span> and the <span class="person">Mudcrabs</span></p>
      
      
      
      <p>The <span class="person">Guar</span> were so tormented by the other creatures they did not know where to go. As soon as
         they saw a single beast approach them, off they dashed in terror.
         
         One day they saw a pack of <span class="person">Nix-hounds</span> ranging about, and in a desperate panic all the <span class="person">Guar</span> scuttled off towards the sea, determined to drown themselves rather than live in
         such a continual state of fear. But just as they got near the shoreline, a colony
         of <span class="person">Mudcrabs</span>, frightened in their turn by the approach of the <span class="person">Guar</span>, scuttled off, and threw themselves into the water.
         
         'Truly,' said one of the <span class="person">Guar</span>, “things are not so bad as they seem. For there is always someone worse off than
         you."
         </p>
      
      
      <p> The Wounded <span class="person">Netch</span></p>
      
      
      
      <p> A wounded <span class="person">Netch</span> lay himself down in a quiet corner of its feeding-ground. His healthy companions
         came in great numbers to inquire after his health, yet each one helped himself to
         a share of the fodder which had been placed there for his use; so that the poor <span class="person">Netch</span> died, not from his wounds, but from the greed and carelessness of his erstwhile friends.
         
         And so it is clear that thoughtless companions may bring more harm than help.</p>
