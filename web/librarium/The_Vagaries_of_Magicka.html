            <p>"...but take care, lest power enfeeble the fundaments, and curtail the flow through
               the Congeries, except when functions be warranted. And safeguard that the Congeries
               shall not be abused by prideful wizards, confident in their skill and blinded by their
               ambitions. In this, hold the ordering of the Congeries among the oldest and most trusted
               of mages, and make secure this ordering through arcane codes and keys to confound
               even the most clever students.</p>
            
            <p>"The Restorals must be most carefully guarded, for how often have even the wise lusted
               to overreach their bodies and souls with vitality and mana. And also must the Magicka
               Fountains be damped and banked, sanctioning their engendering only to the reconsecration
               of essential arcane engines and templates, and then only by common assent of the Council."</p>
