      <p>Who is <span class="person" id="ALMSIVI">ALMSIVI</span>?</p>
      
      <p><span class="location">Morrowind</span> is holy country, and its gods are flesh and blood. Collectively, these gods are called
         the Tribunal, the triune <span class="person">ALMSIVI</span>, three deities exemplifying <span class="group" id="Dunmeri">Dunmeri</span> virtues. <span class="person">Almalexia</span> is Mercy, <span class="person">Vivec</span> is Mastery, and <span class="person">Sotha Sil</span> is Mystery. <span class="person">Vivec</span> is easily the most popular of them all. <span class="person">Vivec</span> is also the most public, for he is the beloved Warrior-Poet of the True People, paradoxically
         beautiful and bloody. <span class="person">Vivec</span> is an artistic violence. <span class="person">Vivec</span> is represented in Temple literature and liturgy as one of the divine kings of <span class="location">Morrowind</span>. He guards the sacred <span class="person">Velothi</span> subcontinent of <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>, and stands guard over <span class="location">Red Mountain</span>, the gate to hell. He is part of the holy Tribunal, a god of the New Temple, and
         an aspect of the blessed and righteous <span class="person">ALMSIVI</span>.</p>
      
      <p>This explicit presentation of <span class="person">Vivec</span> the Guardian God-King and Warrior-Poet is the one most accessible and familiar to
         Westerners. However, it is important to remember that <span class="person">Vivec</span> is also known to the Dunmer as the transcendent evolution of the <span class="group">daedrai</span> that anticipated him, Black Hands Mephala, a foundation figure of the earliest <span class="group">Chimer</span>. This darker side of <span class="person">Vivec</span> does not appear in the popular literature and liturgy, but is instinctively understood
         and accepted by the Dunmer as an integral part of <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s divine aspect. A more complete appreciation of the complex nature of <span class="person">Vivec</span> requires an understanding of the nature of <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s Anticipation, Mephala, and the darker themes represented by this <span class="group">daedrai</span> Lord's modes and motivations.</p>
      
      <p>Who is <span class="person">Mephala</span>?</p>
      
      <p>Each of the three Tribunes of the Temple were represented in the dawn of <span class="group">Chimer</span>i culture by their Anticipations. These Anticipations are known to the West as the
         sinister <span class="group">daedrai</span> Lords <span class="person">Azura</span>, <span class="person">Boethiah</span>, and <span class="person">Mephala</span>. In Temple theology, however, <span class="person">Azura</span> is the Anticipation of <span class="person">Sotha Sil</span>, the Mage-Lord of <span class="person">ALMSIVI</span>. <span class="person">Boethiah</span> is the Anticipation of <span class="person">Almalexia</span>, <span class="person">ALMSIVI</span>'s Mother and Lady. <span class="person">Mephala</span> is the Anticipation of <span class="person">Vivec</span>. According to legend, under the guidance of these three <span class="group">daedrai</span> Lords, a discontented throng of <span class="group">Altmer</span> transformed themselves into a new people and founded a new land. And while <span class="person">Boethiah</span>, the so-called Prince of Plots, provided the revolutionary methods needed to bring
         about this transformation, <span class="person">Mephala</span> was the shadowy implementer of those methods.</p>
      
      <p>As known in the West, <span class="person">Mephala</span> is the demon of murder, sex, and secrets. All of these themes contain subtle aspects
         and violent ones (assassination/genocide, courtship/orgy, tact/poetic truths); <span class="person">Mephala</span> is understood paradoxically to contain and integrate these contradictory themes.
         And all these subtle undercurrents and contradictions are present in the Dunmer concepts
         of <span class="person">Vivec</span>, even if they are not explicitly described and explained in Temple doctrine.</p>
      
      <p>The Dunmer do not envision Lord <span class="person">Vivec</span> as a creature of murder, sex, and secrets. Rather, they conceive of Lord <span class="person">Vivec</span> as benevolent king, guardian warrior, poet-artist. But, at the same time, unconsciously,
         they accept the notion of darker, hidden currents beneath <span class="person">Vivec</span>'s benevolent aspects.</p>
      
      <p>For example, one of the most striking persistent myths associated with <span class="person">Vivec</span> is the story that <span class="person">Vivec</span> conspired with his co-rulers <span class="person">Almalexia</span> and <span class="person">Sotha Sil</span> in the murder of Lord <span class="person">Nerevar</span>, the greatest of Dunmer heroes and generals. The story is derived from <span class="group">Ashlander</span> oral tradition, and is flatly contradicted by all Temple traditions. Nonetheless,
         the tale is firmly established in the Dunmer imagination, as if to say, "Of course
         <span class="person">Vivec</span> would never have conspired to murder Lord <span class="person">Nerevar</span>, but it happened so long ago... who can know the truth?"</p>
      
      <p>The public face of <span class="person">Vivec</span> is benign, sensitive, compassionate, and protective of his followers. At the same
         time, the Dunmer seem irrationally comfortable with the hidden aspects of <span class="person">Vivec</span>, the darker components of violence, lust, and conspiracy associated the more primitive
         and ruthless impulses of the Anticipations.</p>
