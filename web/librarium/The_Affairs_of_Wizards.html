            <p>Want to Become Part of<span class="group" id="HouseTelvanni"> House Telvanni</span>?</p>
            
            <p>Outsiders learning of the rabid isolationist and outlander-hating temperament of<span class="group"> House Telvanni</span> wizards often assume it would be impossible to obtain positions in service to<span class="group"> House Telvanni</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
            
            <p>For example, since the Telvanni vigorously defend the right to own slaves, and since
               they keep many<span class="group"> Argonian</span> and <span class="group"> Khajiit</span> as slaves, many<span class="group"> Argonian</span>s and <span class="group"> Khajiit</span> assume they would not be accepted for service with<span class="group"> House Telvanni</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Not true. Telvanni accept all races as candidates for membership.</p>
            
            <p>And, since the Telvanni are ruled by wizard-lord nobles, many assume they accept only
               candidates of the highest intelligence and willpower.</p>
            
            <p>Not true. Telvanni accept candidates of modest intelligence and willpower.</p>
            
            <p>It is true that advancement in Telvanni ranks depends on high intelligence and willpower,
               and that candidates proficient in the arts of magic -- especially Mysticism, Conjuration,
               Illusion, Alteration, Destruction and Enchanting - can expect to advance faster and
               higher in the ranks.</p>
            
            <p>But adventurers of all races and abilities who apply to Telvanni Mouths at the <span class="location">Telvanni Council Hall</span> in <span class="location">Sadrith Mora</span> for acceptance in<span class="group"> House Telvanni</span> can expect a cordial welcome.</p>
            
            <p>(Telvanni Councilors do not serve on their house councils in person. Instead, they
               are represented by a 'Mouth', a trusted subordinate in residence at the Council Hall,
               acting on his patron's behalf, receiving messengers from their patrons and casting
               their patron's votes in Council affairs.)</p>
            
            <p>The truth is that<span class="group"> House Telvanni</span> wizard-lords depend on loyal, well-paid, skilled retainers for most services. Though<span class="group"> House Telvanni</span> does recruit from their own lower classes, they must go outside their house to hire
               the craftsmen and specialists they need. And since for political reasons<span class="group"> House Telvanni</span> has chosen to reduce its reliance on <span class="group">Redoran</span> mercenaries for protection and security, it has been forced to turn to Western mercenaries
               for guards and agents.</p>
            
            <p>Promotion in the ranks of<span class="group"> House Telvanni</span>, however, is very difficult for outsiders. Most disconcerting for some potential
               candidates is<span class="group"> House Telvanni</span>'s casual acceptance of murder and assassination of rivals as a means to advancement.
               Those reluctant to prove their worthiness by killing off the competition, and those
               uncomfortable about competing in such a ruthless atmosphere, might better employ their
               time and efforts in the <span class="group">Mages Guild</span>.</p>
