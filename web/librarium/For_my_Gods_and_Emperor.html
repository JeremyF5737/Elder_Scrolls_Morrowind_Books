            <p>What is the <span class="group" id="ImperialCult">Imperial Cult</span>?</p>
            
            
            
            <p> The missionary arm of the great faiths, the <span class="group">Imperial
                  cult</span> brings divine inspiration and consolation to the Empire's remote
               provinces. The cults combine the worship of the Nine Divines, the <span class="person" id="AedraAkatosh">Aedra Akatosh</span>, <span class="person">Dibella</span>,
               <span class="person">Arkay</span>, <span class="person">Zenithar</span>,
               <span class="person">Mara</span>, <span class="person">Stendarr</span>, <span class="person">Kynareth</span>, and <span class="person">Julianos</span>, and
               the <span class="person">Talos</span> cult, veneration of the divine god-hero Tiber
               Septim, founder and patron of the Empire. <span class="group">Imperial
                  cult</span> priests provide worship and services for all these gods at Imperial
               shrines in settlements throughout <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p> What is the Virtuous Life?</p>
            
            
            
            <p> Our doctrines are simple. We acknowledge the divinity of the Nine Divines: Akatosh,
               <span class="person">Dibella</span>, <span class="person">Arkay</span>, <span class="person">Zenithar</span>, <span class="person">Mara</span>, <span class="person">Stendarr</span>, <span class="person">Kynareth</span>, <span class="person">Julianos</span>, and Tiber Septim. We preach the Nine Virtues:
               Humility, Inspiration, Piety, Work, Compassion, Justice, Ambition, Learning, and
               Civility. Our Emperor is the Defender of the Faith, and the Empire is the worldly
               working of the Divine Plan. We pledge aid and comfort to all citizens in need, and
               serve
               the Emperor and Empire at his will.</p>
            
            
            <p> The <span class="group">Imperial cult</span>s look to the Nine Divines as models
               for living a good and virtuous life. Each of the Nine represents different aspects
               of
               life, and how it should be lived. But the simplest statement of our doctrines is --
               help
               and protect one another. The stronger one is, the wealthier one is, the more one bears
               responsibility for helping and protecting others. One's first duty, of course, is
               to
               one's fellow members of the <span class="group">Imperial Cult</span>. But after
               that, one should help and protect any needy persons.</p>
            
            
            <p> We also say, "do not harm one another." It is forbidden to attack another person
               of the
               <span class="group">Imperial cult</span>, and of course, forbidden to kill
               another member. It is forbidden to steal from another member, whether by open theft
               or
               by covert pickpocketing. It is forbidden to trespass upon the private property of
               another member. Break any one of these rules, and be expelled from the cult.</p>
            
            
            <p> How can I join the <span class="group">Imperial cult</span>?</p>
            
            
            
            <p> The <span class="group">Imperial cult</span> accepts all citizens of good
               character and earnest faith. We ask only a one-time pledge of 50 drakes to aid us
               in our
               good works. Thereafter, the only cost of membership comes when you use our health,
               healing, and blessing shrines -- modest fees which help us spread the blessings of
               the
               Nine to those less fortunate than ourselves.</p>
            
            
            <p> Those who wish to join the <span class="group">Imperial cult</span> in
               <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> will find a warm welcome from our cult greeters: Ygfa at Fort <span class="location">Pelagiad</span>,
               Syloria Siruliulus at <span class="location">Buckmoth Legion Fort</span>, Somutis Vunnis at <span class="location">Moonmoth Legion Fort</span>,
               <span class="location">Ruccia Conician</span> in the Grand Council Chambers in Ebonheart, or <span class="location">Lalatia Varian</span> in the
               Imperial Chapels at Ebonheart.</p>
            
            
            <p> What are the requirements for advancement in the <span class="group">Imperial
                  cult</span>?</p>
            
            
            
            <p> Seekers who wish to advance in the service of the Nine must dedicate time and resources
               to serving the cult, and must strive for personal improvement in their attributes
               and
               skills. Only the most distinguished are worthy of advancement to the higher ranks
               in the
               <span class="group">Imperial cult</span>s.</p>
            
            
            <p> To serve and glorify the Nine Divines, the faithful must cultivate a noble personality
               and a strong will. Respect the magical arts, especially the colleges of Restoration,
               Mysticism, and Conjuration. Those who swear to avoid bloodshed, to take the field
               unarmored to fight only with blunt weapons, are especially praiseworthy. Knowledge
               of
               enchantments and the gift of diplomatic speech are other qualities we value in our
               initiates.</p>

               <span class="group">Imperial cult</span> services</p>

               Legion Fort, <span class="location">Moonmoth Legion Fort</span>, <span class="location">Pelagiad</span> Legion Fort, <span class="location">Gnisis</span> Legion Fort, Wolverine
               Hall in <span class="location">Sadrith Mora</span>, <span class="location">Vivec</span>, <span class="location">Foreign Quarter</span>, and Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart. Seek
               training at Wolverine Hall, Buckmoth Fort, Moonmoth Fort, Ebonheart Imperial Chapels,
               Governor's Hall in <span class="location">Caldera</span>, and <span class="location">Ald Velothi</span> Outpost.</p>
            
            
            <p> Many <span class="group">Imperial cult</span> locations have healing altars. You
               may pray at <span class="group">Imperial cult</span> healing altars and receive
               blessings which cure common and blight diseases, cure poisons, and restore damaged
               attributes. Non-members pay 25 drakes. Non-members pay 25 drakes. Newer members pay
               10
               drakes, while higher-ranking members receive blessings free. Healing altars are found
               in: <span class="location">Vivec</span> <span class="location">Foreign Quarter</span>; Wolverine Hall in <span class="location">Sadrith Mora</span>; <span class="location">Buckmoth Legion Fort</span>;

            <p> Opportunities for service</p>
            
            
            
            <p> Lay healers gather ingredients for health and healing potions, and minister to the
               sick
               and hurt in poor and isolated communities. It is difficult and sometimes dangerous
               work,
               but the spiritual rewards are great. Lay healers need only the skills of the prudent
               traveler, being often on the road and in the wilderness, gathering herbs and potion
               components. They should avoid trouble where possible, and so need not be masters of
               the
               arts of war. Those interested should speak to Synnolian Tunifus at the Imperial Chapels
               in <span class="location">Ebonheart</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p> Almoners gather alms from members and friends of the faith. We depend on donations
               to
               fund most of our good works. Almoners who are successful at bringing in generous
               donations may rise in the ranks of <span class="group">Imperial Cult</span>s
               service. Almoners must travel in town and village, and should be skilled in persuasion
               and mercantile matters. Also, almoners with personal wealth are in a position to better
               serve the cult. Those interested should speak to <span class="person">Iulus Truptor</span> at the Imperial Chapels
               in <span class="location">Ebonheart</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p> A shrine sergeant helps keep order at the shrines, carries messages and packages,
               and
               sometimes escorts priests and lay servants on dangerous missions. This occasional
               service is ideal for bold, free-spirited adventurers. Shrine sergeants are called
               upon
               to serve the Nine with weapon, armor, and spell. New shrine sergeants are given the
               easiest tasks, but later, missions may demand higher levels of combat proficiency.
               Those
               interested should speak to <span class="person">Kaye</span> at the Imperial Chapels in <span class="location">Ebonheart</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p> Oracle's Quests are the most demanding of all <span class="group">Imperial
                  cult</span> missions. Only members of the higher ranks are invited to assist the
               Oracle, and the challenges require the skill and courage found only in heroes of
               legend.</p>
            
            
            <p> How do the <span class="group">Imperial cult</span>s view the other factions of
               <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>? The <span class="group">Imperial cult</span>s have a very close
               relationship with the Imperial legions, and a friendly and supportive relationship
               with
               the Imperial Guilds -- especially the <span class="group">Fighters</span> and <span class="group">Mages Guilds</span>. We also have a friendly and supportive
               relationship with House Hlaalu, which strongly supports the Emperor and Imperial
               principles. Though we cannot condone the actions of the Thieves Guild, we praise their
               faithful dedication to the Emperor and to Imperial culture.</p>
            
            
            <p> The <span class="group">Imperial cult</span>s have the greatest respect for the
               high moral principles of House Redoran and the <span class="group">Morag
                  Tong</span>, and honors their different but noble conceptions of Divine
               Inspiration.</p>
            
            
            <p> We disapprove of the primitive heathen beliefs of the <span class="group">Ashlanders</span>, and of the impious and inhumane practices of the <span class="group">Telvanni</span>. The <span class="group">Imperial
                  cult</span> especially disapproves of the practice of slavery, and looks forward to
               the day when slavery is illegal in all Imperial provinces. The <span class="group">Imperial cult</span> also disapproves of the lawless and greedy
               <span class="group">Camonna Tong</span>, and their ruthless exploitation of
               the poor and weak.</p>
            
            
            <p> Historically, our relationship with the Tribunal Temple is difficult and unfriendly.
               Though the <span class="group">Imperial cult</span>s acknowledges the lords and
               saints of the Temple pantheon as worthy inspirations, the Temple falsely insists that
               theirs is the One True Faith, and that the <span class="group">Imperial
                  cult</span>s worship false gods.</p>
