            <p>Hear me, children. Once I was a lowly man such as yourselves. By my will I entered
               the ranks
               of the <span class="group" id="gods">gods</span>. By your unquestioning devotion, you can share my glory.</p>
            
            
            <p>Most <span class="group">Necromancers</span> are fools and weaklings. Fodder for the <span class="group">witchhunters</span>. But you, my servants,
               you are among the chosen. In the days to come, few will dare to stand against your
               might.
               But one obstacle remains. His name is <span class="person" id="Arkay">Arkay</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>He was also a man who entered the ranks of the <span class="group">gods</span>. The similarities between his mortal life
               and my own astonish even me. It is only proper that we should be enemies.</p>
            
            
            <p><span class="person">Arkay's</span> Blessing prevents the souls of men, <span class="group">beastmen</span>, and <span class="group">elves</span> from being used without
               consent. <span class="person">Arkay's</span> Law prevents those buried with the proper rituals from being raised to
               serve my children's will. As you know, my children, <span class="person">Arkay's</span> Blessing is flexible to those
               with daring, but <span class="person">Arkay's</span> Law is unwavering.</p>
            
            
            <p>To the Scholars: Humiliate the priests of <span class="person">Arkay</span>. Reveal the primitive burial customs to be
               mere superstition. Befriend kings with honeyed words and bind them to your will. Look
               to my
               children in <span class="location">Cyrodiil</span> for guidance.</p>
            
            
            <p>To the Priests: Use your servants sparingly, let none be seen by the living. Let the
               memories
               of the undead waste away from the people. Send missionaries to the unbound dead, to
               the
               Vampires and the Liches. Let all the nations of dead carry my banner and my banner
               alone.</p>
            
            
            <p>To the Hidden: Wait, as always, in the darkness.</p>
            
            
            <p>For soon we shall strike. The Temples of <span class="person">Arkay</span> will be torn stone from stone. The blood of
               his priests will sate our thirst; their bones will rise as our servants. The name
               <span class="person">Arkay</span> will
               be stuck [sic] from the records. Only I shall hold sway over life and death. Only
               one name
               shall be whispered in fear. The name of your lord and master.</p>
