      <h1> The Buying Game</h1>

      <ul>

      </ul>
      
      <p> So many people simply buy the items they need at the price they are given. It's a
         very
         sad state of affairs, when the game is really open to all, you don't need an invitation.
         And
         it is a game, the game of bargaining, to be played seriously and, I hasten to add,
         politely.
         In <span class="location">Elsweyr</span>, it is common for the shop-owner to offer the prospective buyer tea or sweetmeats
         and engage in polite conversation before commencing the business. This eminently civilized
         tradition has a practical purpose, allowing the buyer to observe the wares for sale.
         It is
         considered impolite not to accept, though it does not imply obligation on the part
         of the
         buyer. </p>
      
      
      <p> Whether this particular custom is part of the culture or not, it's wise for the buyer
         and seller to greet one another with smiles and warm salutations, like gladiators
         honoring
         one another before the battle.</p>
      
      
      <p>  Bargaining is expected all over <span class="location">Tamriel</span>, but the game can be
         broken if one's offer is so preposterously low that it insults the shop-keeper. If
         you are
         offered something for ten gold pieces, try offering six and see where that takes you.</p>
      
      
      <p>Do not
         look like you're very interested, but do not mock the quality of the goods, even if
         they
         deserve it. Much better to admire the quality of workmanship, but comment that, regretfully,
         you simply cannot afford such a price. When the shop-keeper compliments your taste,
         smile,
         but try to resist the flattery.</p>
      
      
      <p> A lot of the game depends on recognizing the types of
         shop-keepers and not automatically assuming that the rural merchant is ignorant and
         easily
         fooled, or the rapacious city merchant is selling shoddy merchandise. Caravans, it
         should be
         mentioned, are always good places to go to buy or trade. </p>
      
      
      <p>Knowing what you're buying and from
         whom is a talent bought only after years of practice. Know the specialties of certain
         regions and merchants before you even step foot in a shop. Recognize too the prejudices
         of
         the region. In <span class="location">Morrowind</span> where I hail from, for example, <span class="group">Argonians</span> are viewed with a certain
         amount of suspicion. Don't be surprised or insulted if the shopkeepers follow you
         around the
         shop, assuming you're going to steal something. Similarly, <span class="group">Nords</span>, <span class="group">Bretons</span>, and <span class="group">Cyrodiils</span> are
         sometimes treated coolly by merchants in the <span class="location">Summurset Isles</span>. Of course, I don't know any
         shopkeepers anywhere, no matter their open-mindedness, who aren't alerted when a <span class="group">Khajiit</span> or
         a <span class="group">Bosmer</span> enters their shop. Even <span class="group">Khajiiti</span> and <span class="group">Bosmeri</span> shopkeepers. 
         </p>
      
      
      <p> If you see something you
         really like or need, buy it then and there at the best price you can get. I cannot
         tell you
         how many times I passed up a rare and interesting relic, assuming that I could find
         it
         elsewhere in the region, perhaps at a larger town at a better price. Too late, I discovered
         I was wrong, and when I returned to the shop weeks later, the item I wanted was gone.
         Better
         to get a great purchase at a decent price and discover it again at a worse price than
         to
         miss out on your opportunities for ownership. Occasionally impulsiveness is the best
         buying
         strategy.</p>
      
      
      <p>Sense the moves of the game, and everyone can win.</p>
