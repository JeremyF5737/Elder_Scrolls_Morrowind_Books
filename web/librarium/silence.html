            <p>“I've heard of you,” said the old vagabond, very impressed. “Aren't you the adventurer
               who slew all those ash vampires in <span class="location">Ghostgate</span> a couple of months back?”</p>
            
            
            <p>“That I am,” said <span class="person">Oristian Silverthorn</span> with a weary smile for his admirer. He knew that his name was not yet legendary,
               and it was best to be polite. “And you are?”</p>
            
            
            <p>“My name would have no meaning to you, but I'm <span class="person">Erer Darothil</span>,” he said, raising a glass of <span class="item" id="greef">greef</span>. “I hail from the region of <span class="location">Ghostgate</span> which is how I heard your name. Are you on an adventure as we speak?”</p>
            
            
            <p>“Yes,” said <span class="person">Silverthorn</span>, with a grim expression. “I'm challenged to rid The <span class="location">Grazelands</span> of a rogue battlemage by the name of <span class="person">Egroamaro</span>.”</p>
            
            
            <p>“I've heard of him as well,” said <span class="person">Darothil</span>. “He is said to be very powerful, an implacable foe.”</p>
            
            
            <p>“That is why I'm drinking now,” sighed <span class="person">Silverthorn</span>. “So tell me, what is your profession?”</p>
            
            
            <p>“I do nothing,” said <span class="person">Darothil</span> with some measure of pride. “But in my youth, I used to teach the skills of Illusion
               at the <span class="location">University of Gwylim</span>.”</p>
            
            
            <p>“Perhaps you can help me then,” said <span class="person">Silverthorn</span>, suddenly excited. “Can you teach the spell Silence? I can certainly pay you.”</p>
            
            
            <p>“I know that spell,” said <span class="person">Darothil</span>. “You might find Invisibility very helpful as well, or perhaps Darkness which would
               allow you to sneak up on old <span class="person">Egroamaro</span>.”</p>
            
            
            <p>“No,” said <span class="person">Silverthorn</span> firmly. “I only have time to learn one spell. I have to kill <span class="person">Egroamaro</span>, collect the award, and be back in <span class="location">Gnisis</span> as quickly as possible. My wife worries when I'm away.”</p>
            
            
            <p><span class="person">Darothil</span> agreed and, as the two settled back in their seats at the cornerclub and tossed back
               glasses of <span class="item">greef</span>, the old man shared his knowledge of the spell. He explained what it truly meant
               to bend sound, creating a cone of silence as glass can bend light. He had <span class="person">Silverthorn</span> close his eyes while he tapped the side of his glass, making him picture the sound
               as the physical entity it was, before it was extinguished.</p>
            
            
            <p>The adventurer, after a few hours of instruction, paid the old teacher and set off
               on his way. <span class="location">Indoranyon</span>, <span class="person">Egroamaro</span>'s stronghold, was not far from <span class="location">Sadrith Mora</span>, and he soon saw the blight and ruin that was the battlemage's calling card. Delving
               into the depths of the ruins, <span class="person">Silverthorn</span> was set upon by the servitors of <span class="person">Egroamaro</span>, living and undead. With his enchanted ebony blade, he cut through legions before
               facing the master himself in the desolate main hall.</p>
            
            
            <p><span class="person">Egroamaro</span> bowed to his adversary sardonically, and then prepared to unleash a fireball to incinerate
               him. Before he had uttered the first word of the spell, he suddenly found that all
               the creaking and sighing of the ruins around him had been stilled. He opened his voice
               to speak, but there was no sound. <span class="person">Silverthorn</span> took his time, strolling across the length of the hall, before dispatching the battlemage
               with one stroke of his blade.</p>
            
            
            <p>The adventurer rushed back to the <span class="location">Tribunal Temple</span> where he had received his quest, accepted the gold and the thanks, and was back in
               his house in <span class="location">Gnisis</span> but a few days later. His wife <span class="person">Liah</span> was beside herself with worry.</p>
            
            
            <p>“All I could do night after night is toss and turn. I kept imagining you burned to
               ashes by that battlemage, and where would that leave me? Do we have enough gold that
               I could support myself if you, <span class="person">Saint Seryn</span> let it not be so, were killed during one of these jaunts? I don't think so. Why couldn't
               you get a nice position at the <span class="group" id="FightersGuild">Fighters Guild</span> right here in town? I hear they're looking for a trainer for the <span class="group">Imperial Guard</span>. I know, I know, you want a life of adventure and danger and freedom, but if you'd
               only take one moment to think of me, stuck here all by myself, worrying about you.
               I suppose you'd like it if I took more of an interest in your work, but it's like
               I was telling Ser <span class="person">Calissiah Vignum</span> the other day, I said <span class="person">Calissah</span>, what good is a husband--”</p>
            
            
            <p><span class="person">Liah</span> continued to talk, deaf to the fact that her words were dead before they left her
               mouth. <span class="person">Silverthorn</span> smiled and nodded his head, enjoying the silence. He could have killed <span class="person">Egroamaro</span> without the spell, he considered, but he could not have survived his wife.</p>
