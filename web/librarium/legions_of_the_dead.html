      <p><span class="group" id="Undead">Undead</span> commonly occur in three basic types: spirit, flesh, and fleshless. Spirit
         revenants like the <span class="group">ancestor ghost</span>, wraith, and dwarven ghost, can only be harmed by
         weapons that are enchanted or made of refined substances such as silver. <span class="group">Ancestor
            ghosts</span>, the most common spirit revenant, are harmless, apart from the minor curses they
         lay upon their victims. Wraiths are similar to ghosts, but they are capable of
         inflicting wounds to the careless explorer. <span class="group">Dwarven ghosts</span> are more dangerous still, but
         they generally appear only in <span class="location">Dwarven ruins</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Flesh revenants, or '<span class="group">zombies</span>' as they are often called in the West, are known as
         '<span class="group">bonewalkers</span>' in <span class="location">Morrowind</span>. Magic preserves the <span class="group">bonewalker's</span> fleshy remains along with
         the bones and spirit. <span class="group">Bonewalkers</span> are readily identified by the sharp protuberances of
         bone and metal employed in the rituals that bind them to this plane. All <span class="group">bonewalkers</span> are
         malevolent and dangerous, but the greater <span class="group">bonewalkers</span> are far worse than the more common
         'lesser' <span class="group">bonewalkers</span>. Thankfully, normal weapons harm <span class="group">bonewalkers</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>It is difficult to generalize about fleshless revenants, or <span class="group">skeletons</span>. The agility and fighting ability of
         the animated remains may depend on the abilities of the <span class="group">revenant's</span> former life, and may
         therefore be weak or strong, or more or less capable with weapons and shields. Fortunately,
         enchanted weapons are not needed to destroy <span class="group">skeletons</span>. An exception is the <span class="group">bonelord</span>, a
         peculiar form of revenant that seems to derive its powers more from its spirit energies
         than
         from the substance of its skeletal remains. <span class="group">Bonelords</span> are very powerful, and very dangerous.
         Normal weapons do not affect them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="group">Vampires</span> were believed to be extinct in <span class="location">Morrowind</span> for
         centuries. <span class="group">Dunmer</span> culture has a special hatred for <span class="group">vampires</span>, and in earlier times the
         <span class="group">Ordinators</span> and <span class="group">Buoyant Armigers</span> hunted them to extinction. In recent years, however,
         <span class="group">vampires</span> have either begun to sneak into <span class="location">Morrowind</span>, or long-dormant ones have been awakened.
         <span class="group">Vampires</span> vary in their substance and power according to their age and accumulated lore, but
         even the weakest <span class="group">vampire</span> is immeasurably stronger than most other undead. Note: <span class="group">Ash vampires</span>
         are not vampires, and are not undead. <span class="group">Ash vampires</span> are extremely dangerous. While their
         spirit and substance may indeed be preserved by some magical process, the holy warriors
         of
         the <span class="group">Tribunal Temple</span> report that spell effects known to affect the undead have no effect on
         <span class="group">ash vampires</span>.</p>
