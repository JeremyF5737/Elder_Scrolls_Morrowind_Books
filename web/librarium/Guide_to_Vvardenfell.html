            <p>        <span class="location">Morrowind</span> is the northeastmost province of the Tamrielic Empire, bounded on the north and east
               by the <span class="location">Sea of Ghosts</span>, on the west by <span class="location">Skyrim</span>, on the southwest by <span class="location">Cyrodiil</span> (also known as the Imperial Province), and on the south by <span class="location">Black Marsh</span> (also known as Argonia). <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> District encompasses Vvardefell [sic] Island, a great land mass dominated by the
               giant volcano <span class="location">Red Mountain</span> and cut off from mainland <span class="location">Morrowind</span> by the surrounding <span class="location">Inner Sea</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        Only recently open to settlement and trade, most of the island's population
               is confined to the relatively hospitable west and southwest coast, centered on the
               ancient city of <span class="location">Vivec</span> and the old Great House district centers at <span class="location">Balmora</span>, <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span>, and <span class="location">Sadrith Mora</span>. The rest of the island is covered by hostile desert wastes, arid grasslands, and
               volcanic badlands, and thinly populated by the nomadic <span class="group" id="Ashlander">Ashlander</span> tribes.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> has nine basic geographic regions, each with their own distinctive plants and terrain
               features. Scholars have based their classifications on the different types of land
               described by the native <span class="group">Ashlander</span>s, so the designations are recognized by most local traders, travelers, and adventurers.
               These geographic regions are called: the <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span>, the <span class="location">Ashlands</span>, <span class="location">Azura's Coast</span>, the <span class="location">Bitter Coast</span>, the Grazelands, <span class="location">Molag Amur</span>, <span class="location">Red Mountain</span>, the West Gash, and <span class="location">Sheogorad</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span></p>
            
            <p>        The <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span> is a region of lush, green, well-watered southern lowlands where most of <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>'s agriculture is found. The area includes <span class="location">Pelagiad</span>, <span class="location">Suran</span>, <span class="location">Vivec</span> City, and <span class="location">Ald Sotha</span> along with the inland lakes and waterways of the <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span> proper. The urban areas of <span class="location">Vivec</span> and <span class="location">Ebonheart</span> of the southern coast are densely populated; the inland <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span> are dotted with small farms and large plantations. The climate is temperate and comfortable,
               with moderate rainfall.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Ebonheart</span> is the seat of the Imperial government for <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> district, and a busy center of maritime trade. <span class="location">Castle Ebonheart</span> is the home of <span class="person">Duke Vedam Dren</span>, the district's ruler and Emperor's representative. Also located at <span class="location">Castle Ebonheart</span> are the <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> District Council chambers and the <span class="group">Hawk Moth Legion garrison</span>. The officers, docks, and warehouses of the <span class="group">East Empire Company</span> are also found in <span class="location">Ebonheart</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Vivec</span> City is the largest settlement on <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>, and one of the largest cities in the East. Each of the great cantons is the size
               of a complete town. The <span class="person">High Fane</span> and the palace of <span class="location">Vivec</span> are visited by hundreds of tourists and <span class="group">pilgrims</span> daily. Citizens flock to the <span class="location">Arena</span> for entertainments and war games. Outlanders mostly confine themselves to the <span class="location">Foreign Canton</span>, while natives live, work, and shop in the Great House compounds and residential
               cantons.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Ald Sotha</span> is a splendid Daedric ruin within sight of <span class="location">Vivec</span> City. Though exotic and picturesque, it is a dangerous site, haunted by old magics,
               dark cultists, and their Daedric summonings, and not recommended for sightseers.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Suran</span> is an agricultural village in the northeastern corner of the fertile <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span> region. Two popular pilgrimage sites are nearby -- the <span class="location">Fields of Kummu</span> and the <span class="location">Molag Bal's Shrine</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Pelagiad</span> is a newly chartered Imperial village between <span class="location">Balmora</span> and <span class="location">Vivec</span> City on the western edge of the <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span> region. The village is right outside the Imperial Legion garrison at Fort <span class="location">Pelagiad</span>. The houses and shops are built in the Western Imperial style, and <span class="location">Pelagiad</span> looks more like a village in the western Empire than a <span class="location">Morrowind</span> settlement.</p>
            
            
            <p>        The <span class="location">Ashlands</span></p>
            
            <p>        The <span class="location">Ashlands</span> are the dry, inhospitable wastelands surrounding the lower slopes of <span class="location">Red Mountain</span>. The <span class="location">Ashlands</span> extend to the <span class="location">Sea of Ghosts</span> in the north, and elsewhere form a wide margin between the blighted <span class="location">Red Mountain</span> region and other geographic regions. The village of <span class="location">Maar Gan</span> is the only sizable permanent <span class="location">Ashlands</span> settlement; <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span>, the district seat of <span class="group">House Redoran</span>, is on the margin of the region. <span class="group">Ashlander</span>s hunt for game here, and their herds find sparse grazing. It rains rarely, and suffers
               frequent ash storms.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Maar Gan</span> is a small isolated village in a remote region north of <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span>. The <span class="location">Maar Gan</span> shrine is an important Temple pilgrimage site.</p>
            
            
            <p>        The <span class="group">Ashlander</span>s Urshilaku tribe has a permanent settlement at <span class="location">Urshilaku camp</span> in the <span class="location">Ashlands</span> region north of <span class="location">Maar Gan</span> village.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Azura's Coast</span></p>
            
            <p>        The rugged coast and islands of northern and eastern <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> are called <span class="location">Azura's Coast</span>. The region is rocky, infertile, and largely uninhabited, except for the outpost
               at Molag Mar, the <span class="group">Telvanni</span> settlements at <span class="location">Sadrith Mora</span>, the wizard towers at <span class="location">Tel Aruhn</span>, <span class="location">Tel Mora</span>, and <span class="location">Tel Branora</span>, and <span class="location">Ahemmusa camp</span> and the remote fishing villages of <span class="location">Ald Redaynia</span> and <span class="location">Dagon Fel</span> on the north coast. There are no roads; most travel is by boat. Despite the rocky
               terrain, a variety of plants thrive on the regular rainfall.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Sadrith Mora</span> is the district seat of House <span class="group">Telvanni</span>, and home of the <span class="group">Telvanni</span> Council, though only one <span class="group">Telvanni</span> councilor actually lives in <span class="location">Sadrith Mora</span>. <span class="location">Sadrith Mora</span> is an island settlement, and accessible only by sea and teleportation. The town is
               large, with many services, but it is open only to <span class="group">Telvanni</span> retainers; outsiders must confine themselves to the <span class="location">Gateway Inn</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Tel Branora</span> is the tower and seat of the eccentric <span class="group">Telvanni</span> wizard named Therana. The tower and its tiny village are located on a rocky promontory
               at the southeasternmost tip of <span class="location">Azura's Coast</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Tel Fyr</span> is the <span class="group">Telvanni</span> tower of Sorcerer-Lord <span class="person">Divayth Fyr</span>. Beneath the tower is the Corprusarium, a refuge-prison where the deranged, distorted
               victims of the deadly corprus disease are housed and tended.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Tel Aruhn</span> is the <span class="group">Telvanni</span> tower of <span class="person">Arch-Mage Gothren</span>, <span class="group">Telvanni</span> Sorcerer-Lord and head of the <span class="group">Telvanni</span> Council. The associated settlement is a sizable village, and the site of the Festival
               Slave Market, the largest slave market on <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Tel Mora</span> is the <span class="group">Telvanni</span> tower of <span class="person">Mistress Dratha</span>, an ancient wizard of the <span class="group">Telvanni</span> Council. The small settlement includes a few craftsfolk and a tradehouse.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Tel Vos</span> is the tower of <span class="group">Telvanni</span> wizard and council member Master <span class="person">Aryon</span>. <span class="location">Tel Vos</span> is a peculiar blend of <span class="group">Telvanni</span> and Western architectural styles, and is close to Vos village.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Bal Fell</span> is the "City of Stone," an ancient First Era ruin in the southeastern islands and
               promontories of <span class="location">Azura's Coast</span>. The site has a nasty reputation, and several <span class="group">Telvanni</span> wizards currently have competing camps of hirelings and adventurers exploring and
               looting there. Legend says that <span class="location">Bal Fell</span> was built on the site of an ancient Daedric worship center.</p>
            
            
            <p>        The <span class="group">Ashlander</span> Ahemmusa tribe has a permanent settlement at <span class="location">Ahemmusa camp</span> on a rocky promontory at the northeastern tip of the <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> mainland in the <span class="location">Azura's Coast</span> region.</p>
            
            
            <p>        The <span class="location">Bitter Coast</span></p>
            
            <p>        The western coast of <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> from Seyda Neen north to <span class="location">Gnaar Mok</span> is called the <span class="location">Bitter Coast</span>. The salt marshes and humid swamps of this region are uninhabited, with the only
               settlements found at the good harbors of <span class="location">Gnaar Mok</span>, Hla Oad, and Seyda Neen. Also called the Smuggler's Coast, the region's secluded
               coves and islands provide refuge for criminal trade, and the frequent rain and fog
               hides small boats from Excise cutters.</p>
            
            
            <p>        The piercing light of the Grand Pharos at the mouth of the harbor of the port
               village of Seyda Neen is a beacon to mariners throughout the <span class="location">Inner Sea</span>. Most visitors from the Empire make landfall at the port of Seyda Neen, where they
               are processed by the Imperial Census and Excise Commission agents of the Coastguard
               station. The Coastguard cutters docked here control smuggling and piracy on the <span class="location">Inner Sea</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        Hla Oad is a tiny isolated fishing village on western <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> in the <span class="location">Bitter Coast</span> region. A rough track along the <span class="location">River Odai</span> connects Hla Oad with the town of <span class="location">Balmora</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Gnaar Mok</span> is a tiny island fishing village in the <span class="location">Bitter Coast</span> region of western <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        The Grazelands</p>
            
            <p>        The regular rain and dark soils of the Grazelands produce the rich grazing
               for <span class="group">Ashlander</span> herds that give the region its name. The region lies in the northeast of <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>, sandwiched between the <span class="location">Ashlands</span> and <span class="location">Azura's Coast</span>. Permanent settlements include Vos village and the towers of <span class="location">Tel Vos</span> and <span class="location">Tel Fyr</span>. The <span class="group">Ashlander</span>s of Zainab camp move their herds across the plains in search of fresh grazing. There
               are no roads or tracks, but travel is easy across the open plains.</p>
            
            
            <p>        The <span class="group">Ashlander</span> Zainab tribe has a permanent settlement at Zainab camp, near the village of Vos in
               the Grazelands region.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Molag Amur</span></p>
            
            <p>        Located inland in the southeast of <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>, <span class="location">Molag Amur</span> is an uninhabited wasteland of rocky hills, steep-sided ravines, lava pools, and
               barren ash pavements. Pathfinding and travel is extremely difficult in this trackless
               wilderness, and is complicated by frequent ash storms. The <span class="group">Ashlander</span>s of <span class="location">Erabenimsun camp</span> hunt game here, but few others venture into this region. The worst part of <span class="location">Molag Amur</span>, called the <span class="location">Great Scathes</span>, is considered impassible even by the <span class="group">Ashlander</span>s.</p>
            
            
            <p>        The outpost at Molag Mar is a fortified stronghold on the southeastern edge
               of the desolate <span class="location">Molag Amur</span> region. Pilgrims bound for the nearby pilgrimage sites at <span class="location">Mount Assarnibibi</span> and <span class="location">Mount Kand</span> take refuge at the outpost's hostels, comforted by the garrison of Redoran and <span class="group">Buoyant Armiger</span> crusaders stationed at the stronghold.</p>
            
            
            <p>        The <span class="group">Ashlander</span> Erabenimsun tribe has a permanent settlement at <span class="location">Erabenimsun camp</span>, an isolated hut settlement in the middle of the desolate <span class="location">Molag Amur</span> region.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Red Mountain</span></p>
            
            <p>        The dominant feature of <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>, <span class="location">Red Mountain</span>, is a vast volcano in the center of <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>. The outer slopes are steep and rugged, and the crater is deep and dotted with surface
               lava. The Ghostfence, a magical barrier which blocks travel as well as seals in the
               harmful, disease-laden weather called 'blight,' rings the volcano's outer slopes,
               and is broken only at Ghostgate. Within the Ghostfence, rain never falls and the sun
               never shines; the only weather is the red and deadly ash-blight.</p>
            
            
            <p>        Ghostgate is the gate citadel of the Ghostfence Ordinator and <span class="group">Buoyant Armiger</span> garrisons. Ghostgate sits astride the only gap through which the monstrous hosts
               of <span class="person">Dagoth Ur</span> might emerge from <span class="location">Red Mountain</span> to threaten the rest of <span class="location">Morrowind</span>. The Ghostfence itself is a colossal magical artifact that completely encircles <span class="location">Red Mountain</span> and prevents the Blight from spilling its corruption across the rest of <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        West Gash</p>
            
            <p>        The western highlands of Vvardefell are called the West Gash. The region extends
               from the <span class="location">Sea of Ghosts</span> on the northwest coast to the inland town of <span class="location">Balmora</span>, where the region is sandwiched between the <span class="location">Bitter Coast</span> and the <span class="location">Ashlands</span>. The trading village of <span class="location">Gnisis</span> is north of <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span>, and the fishing villages of Ald Veloth and <span class="location">Khuul</span> lie on the north coast. The town of <span class="location">Caldera</span> lies near <span class="location">Balmora</span>. The herds of the <span class="group">Ashlander</span>s of <span class="location">Urshilaku camp</span> graze on the sparse but hardy highland vegetation.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Balmora</span> is the district seat of <span class="group">House Hlaalu</span>, and the largest settlement on <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> after <span class="location">Vivec</span> City. Good roads lead north to <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span> and south to <span class="location">Caldera</span>, Seyda Neen, and <span class="location">Vivec</span> City. The Imperial Legion garrison of <span class="location">Fort Moonmoth</span> lies south of <span class="location">Balmora</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Caldera</span> is a recently chartered Imperial town and mining corporation. The <span class="location">Caldera</span> Mining Company has been granted an Imperial monopoly to remove raw ebony from the
               rich deposits here. <span class="location">Caldera</span> has the appearance and flavor of a Western Imperial town.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span> is the district seat of <span class="group">House Redoran</span>, and a large settlement. The <span class="group">Redoran Council Chamber</span> are located inside the shell of an ancient extinct giant crab. Tracks lead north
               to <span class="location">Maar Gan</span> and <span class="location">Gnisis</span> villages and south to <span class="location">Balmora</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Gnisis</span> is a small mining and trade village astride the silt strider caravan route between
               the northwest West Gash and <span class="location">Ald'ruhn</span>.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Ald Velothi</span> and <span class="location">Khuul</span> are tiny fishing villages on the northern coast of the West Gash.</p>
            
            
            <p>        <span class="location">Sheogorad</span></p>
            
            <p>        The large island of <span class="location">Sheogorad</span> lies north of <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>. This island and its associated lesser islands are a maritime wilderness extending
               north from <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span> into the <span class="location">Sea of Ghosts</span>. The region is largely hostile and uninhabited, with two small villages at <span class="location">Ald Redaynia</span> and <span class="location">Dagon Fel</span>. Only <span class="location">Dagon Fel</span> is reached by ship services; all other island-to-island transport must be provided
               by the traveler.</p>
