            <p>Healers' Recipes</p>
            
            <p>Healers should all know the recipes for the following popular potions. Fortunately,
               in most cases, the ingredients are common and cheaply obtained.</p>
            
            <p>To restore health to the afflicted and wounded, combine in equal parts two or more
               of the following cheap and common ingredients: <span class="item" id="marshmerrow">marshmerrow</span>, <span class="item">wickwheat</span>, <span class="item">corkbulb root</span>, and <span class="item">saltrice</span>. <span class="item">marshmerrow</span> is an important crop of the <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span>, but it also grows wild in the <span class="location">Grazelands</span> and on <span class="location">Azura's Coast</span>. <span class="item">wickwheat</span> is a wild <span class="location">Ashland</span> grain that grows in the <span class="location">Grazelands</span>. Corkbulb grows best in the <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span>. Most <span class="item">saltrice</span> comes from southeastern <span class="location">Morrowind</span>, but there are also some new and prospering farms and plantations in the <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span>. <span class="item">saltrice</span> occasionally grows wild in the <span class="location">Grazelands</span> and on <span class="location">Azura's Coast</span>.</p>
            
            <p>To restore fatigue after heavy exertion, combine two or more of the following: <span class="item">crab meat</span>, <span class="item">bread</span>, <span class="item">small kwama egg</span>, and <span class="item">chokeweed</span>. Crabmeat is taken from the <span class="group" id="mud_crab">mud crab</span>, commonly found along all coasts. <span class="item">bread</span> in <span class="location">Morrowind</span> is usually baked from <span class="item">saltrice</span> flour. Kwama eggs are harvested from egg mines, and sold everywhere in <span class="location">Morrowind</span>; the smaller eggs retain properties lost in later states of gestation. <span class="item">chokeweed</span> is a tough shrub growing in the rocky highlands of the <span class="location">West Gash</span>.</p>
            
            <p>To cure common diseases, combine <span class="item">gravedust</span> and <span class="item">green lichen</span>. <span class="item">gravedust</span> is spirit-affinitive dust taken from remains buried in consecrated ground. <span class="item">green lichen</span> is a hardy primitive plant that grows in the <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span> and <span class="location">Azura's Coast</span>.</p>
            
            <p>To restore magicka for spellcasting, combine <span class="item">comberry</span> and <span class="item">frost salts</span>. <span class="item">comberry</span> is a bitter berry, used to make wines. It grows mainly in the <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span>. <span class="item">frost salts</span>, by contrast, are rare and expensive. These crystalline compounds precipitate from
               elemental frost in solution. Such residues may be collected from the remains of <span class="group">frost atronachs</span> that have been banished from the mortal plane.</p>
            
            <p>Travelers' Recipes</p>
            
            <p>Pilgrims and travelers will find the following inexpensive recipes of particular interest.</p>
            
            <p><span class="item">Feather</span> reduces the weary traveler's burdens and can be gained from heather and scuttle.
               Heather is a low evergreen shrub of the <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span>, known for its small, pinkish-purple flowers. Scuttle, <span class="location">Vvardenfell</span>'s favorite local dish, is similar to cheese and made from the flesh of local beetles.</p>
            
            <p>Levitation can be produced from any two of the following ingredients: <span class="item">trama root</span>, <span class="item">racer plumes</span>, and <span class="item">coda flowers</span>. A thick, bitter-tasting root of the trama shrub grows in the <span class="location">Ashland</span>s, <span class="location">Molag Amur</span>, and <span class="location">Red Mountain</span> regions. <span class="item">racer plumes</span> are plucked from dead cliff racers. <span class="item">coda flowers</span> are collected from the primitive draggle-tail plant of the <span class="location">Bitter Coast</span>.</p>
            
            <p>The power of Water Breathing is handy for travelers. A potion may be made from two
               or more of the following ingredients: <span class="item">luminous russula</span>, <span class="item">hackle-lo leaf</span>, and <span class="item">kwama cuttle</span>. <span class="item">luminous russula</span> is a squat, mottled-brown-and-green toadstool mushroom of the <span class="location">Bitter Coast</span> region. <span class="item">hackle-lo leaf</span> is a succulent leaf of the <span class="location">Grazelands</span>, prized for its taste and its roborative powers. <span class="item">kwama cuttle</span> is a tough, waxy substance that comes from sacs in the mouths of kwama.</p>
            
            <p>Adventurers' Recipes</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, the potions most favored by adventurers require more rare and expensive
               ingredients. There are exceptions, like the easy and affordable recipe for fire shield.
               But most such potions require at least one ingredient with high cost in coin or blood.</p>
            
            <p><span class="item">Fire Shield potions</span> can be made from <span class="item">comberry</span> and <span class="item">sload soap</span>. <span class="item">comberry</span> is the bitter berry of the <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span>. <span class="item">sload soap</span> is a waxy substance made from the immature non-sentient forms of the sload. <span class="item">sload soap</span> is not expensive, but is only rarely stocked by apothecaries or alchemists, and cannot
               be collected locally.</p>
            
            <p>An adventurer can fortify his strength with a potion made from <span class="item">ash yams</span> and <span class="item">dreugh wax</span>. Ash yam is a tough tuberous root vegetable common to the <span class="location">Ascadian Isles</span> region. <span class="item">dreugh wax</span> is a tough, waxy substance scraped from dreugh shells. Dreugh are powerful aquatic
               creatures, and hunting them for their hides and wax is a dangerous occupation.</p>
            
            <p>Invisibility, one of the most prized effects of potions, can be made only from crushed
               <span class="item">diamonds</span> and <span class="item">bittergreen petals</span>. Bittergreen is a red flowering plant growing in the <span class="location">Red Mountain</span> region. <span class="item">diamonds</span>, on the other hand, are very rare and expensive and usually must be purchased from
               fine alchemists.</p>
